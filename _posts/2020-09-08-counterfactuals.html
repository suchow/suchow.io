# However...

Which one is worse, missing a flight by 5 minutes and watching it pull away from the gate without you, or missing that same flight by 30 minutes? (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982)
???

In both cases, the outcome is the same --- you miss the flight and have to take the next one or reschedule. What's different in the two cases?

Let's everyone try to think of an example where this has happened to you.

You're not the only one to have had something terribly sad like this happen to you.

For example, consider the olympic games...

# When less is more, the study...

Counterfactuals, e.g. "but-for causation"

"We videotaped all of the National Broadcasting Company
(NBC) coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympic games in Barcelona,
Spain."

Just as a bit of a preview, this idea of counterfactual reasoning plays a large part on our judgments of causality. In fact, in law there is a concept of "but-for causality", which uses counterfactual reasoning explicitly, asking whether it's true that but for the action, the result would not have happened. (For example, but for running the red light, the collision would not have occurred.)

# Modeling counterfactuals, intro

The setup:
- Alarms & earthquakes scenario
- Contigency tables?

---

# Causal graphical models (&ldquo;Bayes nets&rdquo;)

- Networks or "graphs": nodes and edges
- Directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- Dependencies + conditional probabilities
