# The multiarmed bandit

- Multiple options with unknown expected value
- How do we maximize gain?

---

# Examples

- Bayesian A/B testing
- Continuous clinical trials
- Ordering off a menu, again

---

# Exploration vs. exploitation

- Exploration: learn new information
- Exploitation: use information we already have

---

# Solution 1: ε-greedy

- Select a value of ε
- One each trial, flip coin weighted ε
- If heads, select random arm
- If tails, select best arm (thus far)

# Sidenote

- Contextual bandits!

---

# Solution 2: UCB

- Set prior over probability of reward for each arm

# Solution 2: UCB

- Set prior over probability of reward for each arm
- Set counts for number of pulls and rewards (i.e., wins vs. losses)
- Compute the upper-confidence bound (UCB) for each arm
- Pull arm with highest UCB

# Solution #3: Thompson sampling

- Set prior over probability of reward for each arm
- Set counts for number of pulls and rewards (i.e., wins vs. losses)

???

Should look familiar...

# Solution #3: Thompson sampling

- Set prior over probability of reward for each arm
- Set counts for number of pulls and rewards (i.e., wins vs. losses)
- Sample a belief state for each arm
- Pick the best one

# Minimizing regret

Regret is how much worse we'd expect to do using the strategy we did, in comparison to the optimal strategy. Compare to a Marrian computational-level analysis.
