< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent time.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Perception is bounded temporally, with events that are too quick or too slow. We create technologies to perceive temporal scales beyond these bounds (e.g., Muybridge's photos of a galloping horse).

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We represent the past, the present, and the future.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The present moment is a physical reality, but the present as an extended interval is a psychological construction (the "specious present").

"Living systems contain self-sustaining biochemical and biophysical oscillations,
whose periods range from fractions of a second to a year and perhaps
more" &mdash;&nbsp;Gallistel

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have a circadian rhythm (e.g., that guy in a cave).

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have neural oscillations at a range of frequencies.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And disorders, such as Parkinson's, seem to affect the timescale of experience and action.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent cause and effect.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Causation does not equal correlation, but even so, from correlations we can infer causality.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Michotte's studies of launching events were some of the early experiments on the perception of causality. Manipulating the timing and other factors affect perception of causality.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
From Heider & Simmel's movies of correlated movements of shape, we infer a whole world of causal factors, such as chasing and hiding.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Causal graphical models (Bayes nets) are a useful tool for representing the causal structure of probabilistic events. They are made up of nodes that represent events or properties, directed edges that represent causation, and (conditional) probability tables that attach to nodes.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One can draw a casual model that reflects our best understanding of causality, or instead one that reflects a person's incorrect theory about how a particular causal system works.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Occam's razor is the idea that simpler explanations are better explanations. But what is "simpler"? Fewer root causes? Fewer nodes in the casual graphical model? It's up for debate.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Networks aren't useful only for representing causality through Bayes nets.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to represent the structure of our knowledge.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to describe social ties.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to learn.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Networks are made up of {nodes, vertices, entities} and {edges, links}, and can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent other people, their thoughts, their thoughts about our thoughts, &c.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Theory of mind is the spark of social cognition, as seen in the Sally-Anne task.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
There is a debate as to whether theory of mind is best thought of as an intuitive theory ("Theory theory") or rather is the result of simulating what others would think using your own mind ("Simulation theory").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Many social scenarios benefit from social reasoning and their essences are captured in economic games.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Consider Keynesian beauty contests.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Schelling coordination games and focal points ("Schelling points").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And the El Farol Problem / minority game.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
But social reasoning has its limits &mdash; it is bounded.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One such limit is a recursion limit, how many nested layers of thinking about think we can do.

# Overview

- Vision as inference, not direct perception
- Representations of objects
- Neural networks for recognizing objects

???

Three levels, drilling down from the computational to the representational to the implementation level.

---

# The purpose of vision

"Vision is a process that produces from images of the external world a description that is useful to the viewer and not cluttered with irrelevant information." &mdash; Marr

---

# An old debate about the nature of perception

- Direct perception vs. perception as inference

"Light and colours, heat and cold, extension and figures &mdash; in a word, the things we see and feel &mdash; what are they but so many sensations, notions, ideas?" &mdash; George Berkeley

- Consider pain and itching.

- Cohesion
- Boundedness
- Rigidity
- No action at a distance

---

# The cohesion principle
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/cognition/amodal.png" width="40%"/>

???

Talk about habituation as method.

According to the cohesion principle, two surface points lie on the same object only if the points are linked by a path of connected surface points. When two surfaces are separated by a spatial gap (as in Figure 4a) or undergo relative motions that alter the adjacency relations among points at their border (as in Figure 4i), the surfaces lie on distinct objects.

---

# The boundedness principle

???

According to the boundedness principle, two surface points lie on distinct
objects only if no path of connected surface points links them. That is, every
path between two points on distinct objects includes at least one pair of twodimensionally
adjacent surface points that either are separated in depth or
become separated over motion. These points define an object boundary.
When surfaces are neither spatially separated nor separately moving (as in
Figures 4b, 4d, 4f, and 4j), no boundary lies between them, and they are
part of the same object.

---

# The rigidity principle

???

According to the principle of rigidity, objects are interpreted as moving rigidly if such an interpretation exists. Thus, two surfaces that undergo different rigid motions are perceived as distinct bodies rather than as one body with a non-rigid center, unless such a center is detected directly (Figures 4g and 8b).

---

# The no-action-at-a-distance principle

???

According to the no-action-at-a-distance principle, separated
objects are interpreted as moving independently of one another if such
an interpretation exists. Thus, two surfaces that undergo a common rigid
motion are perceived as connected, in the absence of a detectable separation
between them (Figures 2a, 2e, 2f, 4h, and 8a; compare Figure 41).

---

# Why represent objects in this way?

Well, consider the input:

"Bodies move as connected wholes, they move on connected paths, they do not interpenetrate
as they move, they tend not to deform as they move, and they tend to
move separately from one another unless they come into contact." &mdash; Spelke
