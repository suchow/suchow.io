# On representing space.

The first stop on our tour of the mind is space. Every person exists somewhere in space, and a tremendous amount of our daily experience deals with making sure that we move ourselves and the objects under our control from one place to the next.

< recap >

class: center, middle, statement, dark

This course is on cognition.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

The QALMRI method can be used to analyze an experiment by considering the (Q)uestion, (A)lternataive hypotheses, (L)ogic and design, (M)ethods, (R)esults, and (I)nferences.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

We applied the QALMRI method to "The sting of intentional pain" as an example.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

Being curious pays off. Everyday experience can be mined for interesting cognitive phenomena.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

We asked whether there are locations where you consistently get lost.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

We asked how fast your hair grows in mph and why that's absurd.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

We asked if you believe in parapsychological abilities like ESP, mind-reading, forture telling, or mental levitation?

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

We asked about the smartest thing you've seen a (non-human) animal do.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We asked whether you have ever seen a child try to count objects.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We asked for concepts for which English has no word, but another language does.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We asked whether we can define "chair" and "salad".

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems. Pinker's Robot Challenge reveals some. You came up with many others.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
To approximately solve them, the mind uses an arsenal of {mental organs, faculties, subsystems, modules, neural networks, machinery, gizmos, widgets}.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Once identified, the trick is to then reverse engineer the mind's approximate solution to that problem.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Each problem/solution can be analyzed using Marr's levels-of-analysis framework: computational, representational/algorithmic, implementation.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
What exactly is a "representation"? Consider Gallistel's isomorphims, Playfair's maps, and Victor's visualization tools.

# The backstory that cognition tells itself.

- Until 1900s, introspective studies of consciousness
- Early 1900s, behaviorism
- Then the cognitive revolution.

# Psychology as the behaviorist views it.

<quote>&ldquo;The behaviourist views psychology as a purely directive experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. So far, human psychology has been unsuccessful due to the mistaken notion that introspection is the only method available to psychology, and that it is the study of consciousness. Actually, psychology is the study of behavior and therefore need not take recourse to conscious phenomena. Hence, animal psychology is as valid a field of study as human psychology. The laws of behavior of animals must be determined and evaluated in and for themselves, regardless of their generalizability to other animals or humans. This suggested elimination of states of consciousness as the objects of investigation will remove the barrier that exists between psychology and other natural sciences, without neglecting the essential problems of introspective psychology.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>John Watson</em></quote>

# Chomsky on Skinner

<quote>&ldquo;What is so surprising is the particular limitations he has imposed on the way in which the observables of behavior are to be studied, and, above all, the particularly simple nature of the function which, he claims, describes the causation of behavior. One would naturally expect that prediction of the behavior of a complex organism (or machine) would require, in addition to information about external stimulation, knowledge of the internal structure of the organism, the ways in which it processes input information and organizes its own behavior.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Noam Chomsky</em></quote>

# Path integration and dead reckoning

???

What is dead reckoning?
Show a vector on an axis: it has a magnitude and direction. (Highschool physics.)
Wang and Spelke point out possible representations by which path integration could be acheieved: egocentric and geocentric.
Displacement of homeward-bound ants, what do they do?
Problems: errors can accumulate, and requires memory.

# Reorientation

<img width="60%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/cognition/reorientation.png" />

---

class: middle

&ldquo;Animals with cognitive systems as simple as insects
navigate by continuously updating the vectors
specifying their relation to significant environmental
locations such as the nest. As they do so, animals store
egocentric representations of significant places for
recognition, and they use these representations on
trips through familiar territory, falling back on their
path integration system when they wander into novel
terrain. Finally, a variety of animals among fish, birds
and mammals reorient themselves primarily by the
geometry of the surrounding surface layout.&rdquo; &mdash; Wang &amp; Spelke
