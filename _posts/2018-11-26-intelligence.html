< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We also have representations of objects, time, cause and effect, and other people and their thoughts about other people, &c.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Language comprehension must go beyond learning statistics of transitions between words, given that "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is absurd but syntactically unobjectionable.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The organizational framework that linguists and cognitive psychologists use to think about language begins at phonology, and proceeds through morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
At each level of the organizational framework are phenomena characteristic of it, including the McGurk effect, cross-culutral differences phonemic repertoire, generativity (infinite use of finite means), polysemy, indeterminacy of reference, semantic ambiguity, and the four Gricean maxims of conversational cooperation.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Language is also central to several of cognition's great debates, including nativism vs. empiricism, linguistic relativity (the "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis"), and prescriptivism vs. descriptivism.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We need categories for all the reasons Rosch identifies &mdash; in particular, features are correlated across objects.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One theory of what concepts are, the definitional theory, with its intensions and extensions, is lacking because not all categories can be precisely defined, and because some category members are better than others.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Another theory of what concepts are, the prototype theory, suggests that concepts are defined by a prototype and a family resemblance structure among the members.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Categories are organized hierarchically, with basic-level categories, subordinate-level categories, and superordinate-level categories.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Basic-level categories are special, and Rosch delineates their unique properties.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The primacy of basic-level categories may resolve Quine's indeterminacy of reference ("gavagai").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And the shape bias, where the learner assumes that category labels refer to the shape of an object over its surface properties, provides another constraint that helps us acquire new concepts.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Analogies are not just for standardized exams.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Consider the myriad examples of everyday analogical reasoning described in Hofstadter's chapters, including "sour grapes", "exactly the same thing", and idioms from other languages.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One way to think of analogies is to first "embed" concepts in a metric space, using a technique like multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) or word2vec.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Then the vector (direction and distance) from one concept to another describes how those concepts relate, so if one pair of concepts has the same vector as another, they are analogous.

Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection.

Selection.

# Eugenics

Claims:
- There is measurable variation across people (scientific)
- Some of the variants are desirable (moral/political)
- Selective breeding CAN in principle be used to increase abundance of those variants (scientific)
- Selected breeding SHOULD be used to that end (moral/political)

# American eugenics

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e3/United_States_eugenics_advocacy_poster.jpg"/>

???

In the first half of the 20th century, approximately 60,000 people were sterilized under U.S. eugenics programs. Eugenic laws in 32 states empowered government officials in public health, social work and state institutions to render people they deemed “unfit” infertile.

California led the nation in this effort at social engineering. Under California’s eugenic law, first passed in 1909, anyone committed to a state institution could be sterilized. Between the early 1920s and the 1950s, approximately 20,000 people – one-third of the national total – were sterilized in California state institutions for the mentally ill and disabled.

# Nazi eugenics

"You will be interested to know that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of intellectuals who are behind Hitler in this epoch-making program. Everywhere I sensed that their opinions have been tremendously stimulated by American thought... I want you, my dear friend, to carry this thought with you for the rest of your life, that you have really jolted into action a great government of 60 million people."

&mdash; C. M. Goethe, founder of the Eugenics Society of Northern California, in 1934

???

The Nazis were well aware of the American eugenics movement and drew inspiration from it.

Upon returning from Germany in 1934, where more than 5,000 people per month were being forcibly sterilized, the California eugenics leader C. M. Goethe bragged to a colleague:

people with congenital cognitive and physical disabilities (including people who were "feebleminded", epileptic, schizophrenic, manic-depressive, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, deaf, blind)

# General, crystalized, and fluid intelligence.

- General intelligence (G, g, or "g factor")
- Factor analysis of performance, leads to...
- Fluid intelligence (G_f) vs. crystallized (Gc) intelligence.

# Multiple intelligences

Howard Gardner

- musical-rhythmic
- visual-spatial
- verbal-linguistic
- logical-mathematical
- bodily-kinesthetic
- interpersonal
- intrapersonal

???

The theory of multiple intelligences differentiates human intelligence into specific 'modalities', rather than seeing intelligence as dominated by a single general ability.

---

# Intelligence tests, IQ tests

- Old vs. new definition of IQ
- Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)
- Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales
- Raven’s progressive matrices

???

Historically, IQ is a score obtained by dividing a person's mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person's chronological age, both expressed in terms of years and months. The resulting fraction is multiplied by 100 to obtain the IQ score

Now it's based on a bell curve.

# The Bell Curve

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/TheBellCurve.gif" width="30%"/>

???

The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life is a 1994 book by psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Murray, in which the authors argue that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that it is a better predictor of many personal dynamics, including financial income, job performance, birth out of wedlock, and involvement in crime than are an individual's parental socioeconomic status. They also argue that those with high intelligence, the "cognitive elite", are becoming separated from those of average and below-average intelligence. The book was controversial, especially where the authors wrote about racial differences in intelligence and discussed the implications of those differences.
