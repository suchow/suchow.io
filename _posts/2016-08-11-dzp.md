A successful design accounts for the structure of the problem
it is aimed at solving. When it is a human-directed design,
this includes the expectations of its users. How do we arrive
at such a design? One approach starts from first principles
(e.g., simplicity, unity, symmetry, balance) to evaluate the
quality of proposed designs. Here, we introduce design from
zeroth principles, a form of human-in-the-loop computation
that synthesizes a design that conforms to its users’ expectations.
The technique begins by constructing a transmission
chain seeded with a random design. Each user in the chain is
exposed to the design and then recreates it, passing along
their recreation to the next user, who does the same. Through
this iterative process, the users’ perceptual, inductive, and reconstructive
biases directly transform the initial design into
one that is better fit to human cognition. Such designs are easier
to learn and harder to forget. We evaluated the approach in
three domains: stimulus–response mappings, vanity phone
numbers, and letter placement in typeset words—and show
that it produces a good design in each.
