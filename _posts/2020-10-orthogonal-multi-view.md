The internal representations of three dimensional objects within visual memory are only partially understood. Previous research suggests that 3D object perception is viewpoint de- pendent, and that the visual system stores viewpoint perspec- tives in a biased manner. The aim of this project was to ob- tain detailed estimates of the distributions of 3D object views in shared human memory. We devised a novel experimental paradigm based on transmission chains to investigate memory biases for the 3D orientation of objects. We found that memory tends to be biased towards orthogonal diagrammatic perspec- tives aligned with the ends of the standard basis for a set of common 3D objects, and that these biases are strongest for side views as well as top or bottom views for a small set of bilater- ally symmetric objects. Finally, we found that views sampled from the modes were easier to categorize in a recognition task.
