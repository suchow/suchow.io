The study of mental phenomena that are excluded from or inexplicable by orthodox scientific psychology (such as hypnosis, telepathy, etc.).

< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We also have representations of objects, time, cause and effect, and other people and their thoughts about other people, &c.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Language comprehension must go beyond learning statistics of transitions between words, given that "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is absurd but syntactically unobjectionable.

---

The organizational framework that linguists and cognitive psychologists use to think about language begins at phonology, and proceeds through morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
At each level of the organizational framework are phenomena characteristic of it, including the McGurk effect, cross-culutral differences in phonemic repertoire, generativity (infinite use of finite means), polysemy, indeterminacy of reference, semantic ambiguity, and the four Gricean maxims of conversational cooperation.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Language is also central to several of cognition's great debates, including nativism vs. empiricism, linguistic relativity (the "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis"), and prescriptivism vs. descriptivism.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We need categories for all the reasons Rosch identifies &mdash; in particular, that features are correlated across objects.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One theory of what concepts are, the definitional theory, with its intensions and extensions, is lacking because not all categories can be precisely defined, and because some category members are better than others.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Another theory of what concepts are, the prototype theory, suggests that concepts are defined by a prototype and a family resemblance structure among the members.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Categories are organized hierarchically, with basic-level categories, subordinate-level categories, and superordinate-level categories.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Basic-level categories are special, and Rosch delineates their unique properties.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The primacy of basic-level categories may resolve Quine's indeterminacy of reference ("gavagai").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And the shape bias, where the learner assumes that category labels refer to the shape of an object over its surface properties, provides another constraint that helps us to acquire new concepts.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Analogies are not just for standardized exams.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Consider the myriad examples of everyday analogical reasoning described in Hofstadter's chapters, including "sour grapes", "exactly the same thing", and idioms from other languages.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One way to think of analogies is to first "embed" concepts in a metric space, using a technique like multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) or word2vec.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Then the vector (direction and distance) from one concept to another describes how those concepts relate, so if one pair of concepts has the same vector as another, they are analogous.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
What is intelligence? There are many ideas, from the ability to acquire and use knowledge, to the ability to think abstractly, to the ability to reason about others, to the ability to quickly determine the essence of a situation.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
A popular conceptualization of intelligence breaks down general intelligence ("g") into two factors, crystalized and fluid intelligence, as determined by a factor analysis of task performance.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Intelligence can be meausured via IQ tests such as Raven's Progressive Matrices.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
However, the enterprise of meausuring intelligence has a complicated and troubled history, one intertwined with the eugenics movement.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

The wisdom of the crowd is the finding that the aggregate decision of a group outperforms the decisions of the individuals within it.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
A rule for aggregating individual decisions into a collective decision is an example of a mechanism, and the field of mechanism design studies how to design the rules to induce rational agents to behave in a way that reaches the designer's goals, like an auction that maximizes income.

---

class: center, middle, dark
Some mechanisms cause decison-making to go off the rails, such as when chance alignment between early estimates in a sequence of publicly announced decisions severly biases later decisions in the chain &mdash; an information cascade.

---

class: center, middle, dark
And finally, transactive memory is an interpersonal form of memory that allows us to encode and retrieve memories held by others. In interactive cueing, a series of reminders allows the collective to recall something that none of the individuals could alone.

1. People's experiences are real.

2. The reason is not what they think.

# Psi, anomalous retroactive influences on cognition

- Precognition (conscious cognitive awarness)
- Premonition (affective apprehension)

???

Experiments done by Daryl Bem in the psychology department at Cornell

From the participantsâ€™ point of view, this procedure appears to
test for clairvoyance. That is, participants were told that a picture
was hidden behind one of the curtains, and their challenge was to
guess correctly which curtain concealed the picture. In fact, however,
neither the picture itself nor its left/right position was determined
until after the participant recorded his or her guess, making
the procedure a test of detecting a future event (i.e., a test of
precognition).

# Some statistical issues

A demo.

- Small sample sizes cause high variability
- Pubication bias
- Inference-dependent stopping rules ("p-hacking")

# What do you think?

A discussion.

1. Among phenomena such as ESP, mind-reading, forture telling, mental levitation, alien visions, &c., which is closest to the edge of uncertainty for you?
2. What sort of evidence would it take to convince you one way or the other?
