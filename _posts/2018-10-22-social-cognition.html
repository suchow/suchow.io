< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent time.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Perception is bounded temporally, with events that are too quick or too slow. We create technologies to perceive temporal scales beyond these bounds (e.g., Muybridge's photos of a galloping horse).

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We represent the past, the present, and the future.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The present moment is a physical reality, but the present as an extended interval is a psychological construction (the "specious present").

"Living systems contain self-sustaining biochemical and biophysical oscillations,
whose periods range from fractions of a second to a year and perhaps
more" &mdash;&nbsp;Gallistel

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have a circadian rhythm (e.g., that guy in a cave).

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have neural oscillations at a range of frequencies.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And disorders, such as Parkinson's, seem to affect the timescale of experience and action.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent cause and effect.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Causation does not equal correlation, but even so, from correlations we can infer causality.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Michotte's studies of launching events were some of the early experiments on the perception of causality. Manipulating the timing and other factors affect perception of causality.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
From Heider & Simmel's movies of correlated movements of shape, we infer a whole world of causal factors, such as chasing and hiding.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Causal graphical models (Bayes nets) are a useful tool for representing the causal structure of probabilistic events. They are made up of nodes that represent events or properties, directed edges that represent causation, and (conditional) probability tables that attach to nodes.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One can draw a casual model that reflects our best understanding of causality, or instead one that reflects a person's incorrect theory about how a particular causal system works.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Occam's razor is the idea that simpler explanations are better explanations. But what is "simpler"? Fewer root causes? Fewer nodes in the casual graphical model? It's up for debate.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Networks aren't usefuly only for representing causality through Bayes nets.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to represent the structure of our knowledge.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to describe social ties.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to learn.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Networks are made up of {nodes, vertices, entities} and {edges, links}, and can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.

# Theory of mind

Consider: "theory theory" vs. "simulation theory"

# The Sallyâ€“Anne test.

???

In the Baron-Cohen et al. (1985) study, 23 of the 27 clinically unimpaired children (85%) and 12 of the 14 Down's syndrome children (86%) answered the Belief Question correctly. However, only four of the 20 autistic children (20%) answered correctly. Overall, children under the age of four, along with most autistic children (of older ages), answered the Belief Question with "Anne's box", seemingly unaware that Sally does not know her marble has been moved.

Bob and Linda are two characters on a TV show. Bob is secretly obsesesd with cats, and always has been, but he's embarrased about it. Bob doesn't want Linda to know how much he loves cats, and so he's hidden his obsession from her throughout their relationship. He pretends he doesn't care much for them, but he really does. It turns out that Linda has always known that Bob loves cats, but Bob doesn't realize that Linda knows. Bob thinks he's managed to hide his cat obsession from her, but he hasn't. Even better, Linda is aware that Bob doesn't realize she knows, and so she often uses this knowledge to her advantage. For example, every so often they'll go together to a pet store, and Linda will hold up the cutest kitten in the whole world and ask Bob if he'd like to pet it. Bob says no, not wanting to let on how much he wants to, and Linda holds it even closer to him, trying to get him to break and admit how much he loves cats.

We the audience find this scenario entertaining because we understand that Linda is aware that Bob doesn't realize that Linda knows that Bob is obsessed with cats.

And the creators of the show wrote and edited the story in the precise way they did because they knew that we would understand that Linda is aware that Bob doesn't realize that Linda knows that Bob is obsessed with cats.

And so here we are, you and I. I told you this story because I knew that having told it, you'd learn that the creators of the show knew that we the audience would understand that Linda is aware that Bob doesn't realize that Linda knows that Bob is obsessed with cats.

N people decide independently
each week whether to go to a bar
that offers entertainment on a certain night.
For concreteness, let us set N at 100. Space
is limited, and the evening is enjoyable if
things are not too crowded-specifically, if
fewer than 60 percent of the possible 100
are present. There is no sure way to tell the
numbers coming in advance; therefore a
person or agent goes (deems it worth going)
if he expects fewer than 60 to show up or
stays home if he expects more than 60 to go.

1. Requires modeling and reasoning about the thoughts of others.
2. Most solutions are self-invalidating if adopted by the group.
