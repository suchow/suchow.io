water,  
water,  
water,  
i love you.

you make brown sticks and you make me grow.  
i love everything i know.

water,  
water,  
water,  
i love you.

you flush toilets,  
and you make ducks swim, too.  

we need water for raccoons so they can wash off  
...and babies too.

we need water for everything.

oh water, water.  
i want to drink you.
