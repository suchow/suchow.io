# Getting curious about cognition.

One of the benefits of studying human mental life is that you have a rich repository of first-hand experience to draw from. The goal of today's class is to encourage a curious mindset about everyday cognition, generating many more questions than answers. To accomplish this, we'll do a sequence of short discussions and exercises.

First, break out into groups of around 4 to 5 people.

Then proceed to the next slide.

These are the presenter notes.

# Question 1.

Are there any locations (buildings, neighborhoods, cities) where you consistently get lost or find it difficult to navigate? What is it about the place that causes this? And what is it about you?

_Take 6 minutes to discuss this in your group._

---

# Question 2.

How fast does your hair grow in units of miles per hour? Why does this question seem so absurd and why don’t you immediately know the answer to it? Why can’t you calculate it in an instant?

_Take 6 minutes to discuss this in your group._

# Question 3.

Do you believe in ESP, mind-reading, forture telling, or mental levitation? (FYI, when I've asked this question to groups in the past, about half the people have believed that at least one of these is possible, so know that you're not alone either way.) If you do, what has led to this belief? If not, what evidence would it take to convince you that they are real?

_Take 10 minutes to discuss this in your group._

# Question 4.

What's the smartest thing you've seen a (non-human) animal do, either in person or in a video? What was surprising about what you saw? What might it tell you about that animal's cognitive capacities?

_Take 10 minutes to discuss this in your group._

# Question 5.

Have you ever seen a child try to count objects? Did they do anything unusual or silly? What might that tell you about their understanding of what it means to count?

_Take 6 minutes to discuss this in your group._

---

# Question 6.

Do you know any concepts for which English has no word, but another language does? Find as many as you can.

_Take 6 minutes to discuss this in your group._

---

# Question 7.

What is the definition of a "chair"? Assign a person or two in your group to be the devil's advocate, finding a flaw in your definition by identifying something that either is called a chair and doesn't match the stated definition, or that isn't called a chair but does match the definition. Repeat until you're all satisfied with the definition.

Then do the same for "salad".

_Take 10 minutes to discuss this in your group._

# Debriefing.

Today's discussions, which were meant to generate curiosity about cognition from a first-hand perspective, touched upon many of the ideas we will encounter throughout the semester, including representations of space, representations of quantity, evaluating evidence for cognitive capacities, animal cognition, cognitive development, categories, and the limits of language.

_Thanks for coming!_
