class: center, middle, statement
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems.

---

class: center, middle, statement
To approximately solve them, the mind uses an arsenal of {mental organs, faculties, subsystems, modules, neural networks, machinery, gizmos, widgets}.

---

class: center, middle, statement
Once identified, the trick is to then reverse engineer the mind's approximate solution to that problem.

---

class: center, middle, statement
Each problem/solution can be analyzed using Marr's levels-of-analysis framework.

Let's start with the first statement.

# Pinker&rsquo;s robot challenge.

"What does it take to build a robot?"

* Sight
* Motor coordination
* Common sense
* Moral reasoning

???

Asks us to think through the hypothetical...

**Students describe each.**

- Compositionality
- Brain trauma
- Twin studies?

- "In forward-engineering, one designs a machine to do something; in reverse-engineering, one figures out what a machine was designed to do."

# Marr&rsquo;s levels of analysis
* Computational level
* Representational (or "algorithmic") level
* Implementation level

???
- Defines the problem — the goal, the inputs, the outputs, the constraints. AI, philosophy, etc. can often be used to determine the optimal solution.
- the representation and processes used by the system to solve the problem. This is the work of cognitive psychology, but AI, computer science, probability theory, etc. provide a useful hypothesis space for understanding what different solutions could look like.
- how those representations and processes are instantiated.

---

# Computational level

"What is the goal of the computation, why is it appropriate, and what is the logic of the strategy by which it can be carried out?"

???

- a formal description of the problem
- input
- output
- constraints
- possible solutions
- optimal or "ideal" solution
- tools from mathematics, probability and statistics, philosophy, computer science, and economics are often helpful here.

---

# Representational (or "algorithmic") level
"How can this computational theory be implemented? In particular what is the representation for the input and output, and what is the algorithm for the transformation?"

---

class: center, middle, statement
What exactly is a "representation"?

---

# Exercise.

Come up with three different ways to represent the number _???_ on a page.

(Playfair, 1786)

???

This is the first plot, by William Playfair in 1786. In Brett Victor's talk, "The humane representation of thought", he dicusses this in the context of representations. In the same way that our own mental machinery can represent the outside world, we can put pen to paper and craft a physical representation of the outside world. Finding effective representations, like the data plot, has been transformative. Similarly, in our individual development and in culture, finding effective mental representations can be similarly transformative. Often having the right representation of a problem makes solving it much easier.

Humane representation of thought

class: center, middle, statement
What exactly is an "algorithm"?

???

What sorts of processes/algorithms are suitable for each representation you developed?

---

# Implementation level
"How can the representation and algorithm be realized physically?"

---

class: center, middle, statement
Let's consider the Reichardt detector.

???

- Objects move in the environment.
- Animals would often like to detect that motion.
- Frog vision, barn owl audition.
- Try to apply Marr's framework.
- Make a live one.
- Same solution can be applied to other problems (e.g., barn owl sound localization).
