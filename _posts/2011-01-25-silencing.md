Loud bangs, bright flashes, and intense shocks capture
attention, but other changes—even those of similar magnitude—can
go unnoticed. Demonstrations of change blindness
have shown that observers fail to detect substantial
alterations to a scene when distracted by an irrelevant flash,
or when the alterations happen gradually. Here, we
show that objects changing in hue, luminance, size, or shape
appear to stop changing when they move. This motioninduced
failure to detect change, silencing, persists even
though the observer attends to the objects, knows that
they are changing, and can make veridical judgments about
their current state. Silencing demonstrates the tight
coupling of motion and object appearance.
