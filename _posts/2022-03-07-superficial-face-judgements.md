The diversity of human faces and the contexts in which they appear gives rise to an
expansive stimulus space over which people infer psychological traits (e.g., trustworthiness or alertness) and other attributes (e.g., age or adiposity). Machine learning
methods, in particular deep neural networks, provide expressive feature representations
of face stimuli, but the correspondence between these representations and various
human attribute inferences is difficult to determine because the former are highdimensional vectors produced via black-box optimization algorithms. Here we combine
deep generative image models with over 1 million judgments to model inferences of
more than 30 attributes over a comprehensive latent face space. The predictive accuracy
of our model approaches human interrater reliability, which simulations suggest would
not have been possible with fewer faces, fewer judgments, or lower-dimensional feature
representations. Our model can be used to predict and manipulate inferences with
respect to arbitrary face photographs or to generate synthetic photorealistic face stimuli
that evoke impressions tuned along the modeled attributes.
