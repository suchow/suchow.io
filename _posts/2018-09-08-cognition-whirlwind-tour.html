< recap >

class: center, middle, statement, dark

This course is on cognition.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

The QALMRI method can be used to analyze an experiment.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

It considers the (Q)uestion, (A)lternataive hypotheses, (L)ogic and design, (M)ethods, (R)esults, and (I)nferences.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

We applied the method to "The sting of intentional pain" as an example.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

Being curious pays off. Everyday experience can be mined for interesting cognitive phenomena.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

Here are the questions we started with:

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

Are there any locations (buildings, neighborhoods, cities) where you consistently get lost or find it difficult to navigate? What is it about the place that causes this? And what is it about you?

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

How fast does your hair grow in units of miles per hour? Why does this question seem so absurd and why don’t you immediately know the answer to it? Why can’t you calculate it in an instant?

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

Do you believe in ESP, mind-reading, forture telling, or mental levitation? If you do, what has led to this belief? If not, what evidence would it take to convince you that they are real?

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

What's the smartest thing you've seen a (non-human) animal do, either in person or in a video? What was surprising about what you saw? What might it tell you about that animal's cognitive capacities?

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

Have you ever seen a child try to count objects? Did they do anything unusual or silly? What might that tell you about their understanding of what it means to count?

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

Do you know any concepts for which English has no word, but another language does? Find as many as you can.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

What is the definition of a "chair"? Assign a person or two in your group to be the devil's advocate, finding a flaw in your definition by identifying something that either is called a chair and doesn't match the stated definition, or that isn't called a chair but does match the definition. Repeat until you're all satisfied with the definition.

Then do the same for "salad".

Today

class: center, middle, statement
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems.

---

class: center, middle, statement
To approximately solve them, the mind uses an arsenal of {mental organs, faculties, subsystems, modules, neural networks, machinery, gizmos, widgets}.

---

class: center, middle, statement
Once identified, the trick is to then reverse engineer the mind's approximate solution to that problem.

---

class: center, middle, statement
Each problem/solution can be analyzed using Marr's levels-of-analysis framework.

---
class: center, middle, statement

Let's start with the first statement.

---
class: center, middle, statement
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems.

# Pinker&rsquo;s robot challenge.

"What does it take to build a robot?"

* Sight
* Motor coordination
* Common sense
* Moral reasoning

???

Asks us to think through the hypothetical...

**Students describe each.**

# Activity.

<!-- Famous story about vision as a summer project -->

---

class: center, middle, statement
To approximately solve them, the mind uses an arsenal of {mental organs, faculties, subsystems, modules, neural networks, machinery, gizmos, widgets}.

???

- Compositionality
- Brain trauma
- Twin studies?

---

class: center, middle, statement
Once identified, the trick is to then reverse engineer the mind's approximate solution to that problem.

???

- "In forward-engineering, one designs a machine to do something; in reverse-engineering, one figures out
what a machine was designed to do."

---

---

class: center, middle, statement
Each problem/solution can be analyzed using Marr's levels-of-analysis framework.

???

- Mention that Marr was Professor Ellen Hildreth's advisor.
- David Marr died of leukemia before this book was ever published.

---

# Marr&rsquo;s levels of analysis
* Computational level
<!-- Defines the problem — the goal, the inputs, the outputs, the constraints. AI, philosophy, etc. can often be used to determine the optimal solution. -->
* Representational (or "algorithmic") level
<!-- the representation and processes used by the system to solve the problem. This is the work of cognitive psychology, but AI, computer science, probability theory, etc. provide a useful hypothesis space for understanding what different solutions could look like. -->
* Implementation level
<!-- how those representations and processes are instantiated. -->

---

# Computational level

"What is the goal of the computation, why is it appropriate, and what is the logic of the strategy by which it can be carried out?"

???

- a formal description of the problem
- input
- output
- constraints
- possible solutions
- optimal or "ideal" solution
- tools from mathematics, probability and statistics, philosophy, computer science, and economics are often helpful here.

---

# Representational (or "algorithmic") level
"How can this computational theory be implemented? In particular what is the representation for the input and output, and what is the algorithm for the transformation?"

---

class: center, middle, statement
What exactly is a "representation"?

---

# Exercise.

Come up with three different ways to represent the number _???_ on a page.

---

class: center, middle, statement
Gallistel says a "functioning isomorphism".

???

Describe an isomorphism in the context of a map of the classroom.

(Playfair, 1786)

???

This is the first plot, by William Playfair in 1786. In Brett Victor's talk, "The humane representation of thought", he dicusses this in the context of representations. In the same way that our own mental machinery can represent the outside world, we can put pen to paper and craft a physical representation of the outside world. Finding effective representations, like the data plot, has been transformative. Similarly, in our individual development and in culture, finding effective mental representations can be similarly transformative. Often having the right representation of a problem makes solving it much easier.

---

class: center, middle, statement
What exactly is an "algorithm"?

---

# Exercise.

What sorts of processes/algorithms are suitable for each representation you developed?

---

# Implementation level
"How can the representation and algorithm be realized physically?"

---

class: center, middle, statement
Let's consider the Reichardt detector.

---

class: center, middle
<img width="70%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/cognition/reichardt.png" />

???

- Objects move in the environment.
- Animals would often like to detect that motion.
- Frog vision, barn owl audition.
- Try to apply Marr's framework.
- Make a live one.
- Same solution can be applied to other problems (e.g., barn owl sound localization).
