class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

# Administrivia
- Attendance sheet
- Assignment #5 &mdash; from 10 questions down to 3

# Sum.

- By David Eagleman

---

# Time at the computational level.

- What is the purpose of representing time?
- What would make it hard to program a robot to represent time?

???

---

# The long and short of it

- Events that are too fast, fast, slow, and too slow

- The past, the present, and the future

- Temporal relations, cultural differences, language

- The implementation level

# Too fast &mdash; the galloping horse.

- Marey, a physiologist

- Muybridge, a photographer

- Debate of the 1870s &mdash; does a galloping horse keep at least one leg on the ground at all times?

- Why isn't this obvious? Well, let's see...

# Too slow &mdash; revisiting the ANS & AMS.

# How long is "just right"?

- Boundary between events and continuity, e.g. drum roll
- Orders of magnitude number line

# The specious present.

"...the prototype of all conceived times is the specious present, the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible." &mdash; James

# Implementation &mdash; oscillators.

"Living systems contain self-sustaining biochemical and biophysical oscillations,
whose periods range from fractions of a second to a year and perhaps
more" &mdash; Gallistel

# Neural oscillations.

"The first discovered and best-known frequency band is alpha activity (7.5–12.5 Hz)[7] that can be detected from the occipital lobe during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the eyes are closed.[8] Other frequency bands are: delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), low gamma (30–70 Hz), and high gamma (70–150 Hz) frequency bands, where faster rhythms such as gamma activity have been linked to cognitive processing."
