< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We also have representations of objects, time, cause and effect, and other people and their thoughts about other people, &c.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Language comprehension must go beyond learning statistics of transitions between words, given that "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is absurd but syntactically unobjectionable.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The organizational framework that linguists and cognitive psychologists use to think about language begins at phonology, and proceeds through morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
At each level of the organizational framework are phenomena characteristic of it, including the McGurk effect, cross-culutral differences phonemic repertoire, generativity (infinite use of finite means), polysemy, indeterminacy of reference, semantic ambiguity, and the four Gricean maxims of conversational cooperation.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Language is also central to several of cognition's great debates, including nativism vs. empiricism, linguistic relativity (the "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis"), and prescriptivism vs. descriptivism.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We need categories for all the reasons Rosch identifies &mdash; in particular, features are correlated across objects.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One theory of what concepts are, the definitional theory, with its intensions and extensions, is lacking because not all categories can be precisely defined, and because some category members are better than others.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Another theory of what concepts are, the prototype theory, suggests that concepts are defined by a prototype and a family resemblance structure among the members.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Categories are organized hierarchically, with basic-level categories, subordinate-level categories, and superordinate-level categories.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Basic-level categories are special, and Rosch delineates their unique properties.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The primacy of basic-level categories may resolve Quine's indeterminacy of reference ("gavagai").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And the shape bias, where the learner assumes that category labels refer to the shape of an object over its surface properties, provides another constraint that helps us acquire new concepts.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Analogies are not just for standardized exams.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Consider the myriad examples of everyday analogical reasoning described in Hofstadter's chapters, including "sour grapes", "exactly the same thing", and idioms from other languages.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One way to think of analogies is to first "embed" concepts in a metric space, using a technique like multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) or word2vec.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Then the vector (direction and distance) from one concept to another describes how those concepts relate, so if one pair of concepts has the same vector as another, they are analogous.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
What is intelligence? There are many ideas, from the ability to acquire and use knowledge, to the ability to think abstractly, to the ability to reason about others, to the ability to quickly determine the essence of a situation.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
A populator conceptualization of intelligence breaks down general intelligence ("g") into two factors, crystalized and fluid intelligence, as determined by a factor analysis of task performance.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Intelligence can be meausured via IQ tests such as Raven's Progressive Matrices.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
However, the enterprise of meausuring intelligence has a complicated and troubled history, one intertwined with the eugenics movement.

# Aggregation mechanism

- Mean vs. median (democratic &mdash; mean can be subverted)
- Simultaneously vs. in sequence
- Number of participants

---

# Information cascades

- Participants respond sequentially, in public
- Unduly influenced by initial estimates, particularly if they are similar

What are the most effective network structures and processes?

---

# Mechanism design

- "Reverse" game theory
- Voting mechanisms (median, instant-runoff)
- Auctions (English, Japanese, Dutch, blind, Vickrey)

Mechanisms can be chosen to maximize efficiency and sharing of information (e.g., market designs).

???

English starts low with bids

Japanese starts low and continuously rises

Dutch starts high and rises

Blind, everyone submits a private bid, highest wins

Vickrey, sealed-bid second-price auction. Winner pays the second-highest bid.

# Transactive memory

(Wegner, 1986)

- Encoding (who stores what, specialization)
- Retrieval (who knows what)
- Interactive cueing

---

# An example of interactive cueing

- Rudy and Lulu, from Wegner, Giuliano, and Hertel (1985)

???

"
Let us consider a simple example to bring these ideas down to earth. Suppose
we are spending an evening with Rudy and Lulu, a couple married for several
years. Lulu is in another room for the moment, and we happen to ask Rudy
where they got the wonderful stuffed Canadian goose on the mantle. Rudy says,
"We were in British Columbia .. . ," and then bellows, "Lulu! What was the
name of that place where we got the goose?" Lulu returns to the room to say that
it was near Kelowna or Penticton-somewhere along Lake Okanogan. Rudy
says, "Yes, in that area with all the fruit stands." Lulu finally makes the
identification: Peachland. In all of this, the various ideas that Rudy and Lulu
exchange lead them through their individual memories. In a process of
interactive cueing, they move sequentially toward the retrieval of a memory
trace, the existence of which is known to both of them. And it is just possible
that, without each other, neither Rudy nor Lulu could have produced the item.
