<!-- “The truth is you already know what it's like. You already know the difference between the size and speed of everything that flashes through you and the tiny inadequate bit of it all you can ever let anyone know. As though inside you is this enormous room full of what seems like everything in the whole universe at one time or another and yet the only parts that get out have to somehow squeeze out through one of those tiny keyholes you see under the knob in older doors. As if we are all trying to see each other through these tiny keyholes.

But it does have a knob, the door can open. But not in the way you think...The truth is you've already heard this. That this is what it's like. That it's what makes room for the universes inside you, all the endless inbent fractals of connection and symphonies of different voices, the infinities you can never show another soul. And you think it makes you a fraud, the tiny fraction anyone else ever sees? Of course you're a fraud, of course what people see is never you. And of course you know this, and of course you try to manage what part they see if you know it's only a part. Who wouldn't? It's called free will, Sherlock. But at the same time it's why it feels so good to break down and cry in front of others, or to laugh, or speak in tongues, or chant in Bengali--it's not English anymore, it's not getting squeezed through any hole.

So cry all you want, I won't tell anybody.”

### Assignments

#### 1 --- You and your learning.
`2018-09-07`

_Instructions_: Complete the introductory survey sent to you by email and submit it in the body of a reply (only) to me.

#### 2 --- Getting curious about cognition.
`2018-09-14`

_Instructions_: As part of this course, you will write a final paper that uses existing research on human cognition to answer a question that you've posed. The first step is to think of some good questions. What drew you to the study of the mind? What have you experienced or noticed about yourself or others that seems interesting, strange, wonderful, or hard to explain? What are you curious about? In this assignment, you will generate a list of 10 questions about cognition. For example, some questions I've had recently are "What's going on when I struggle to recall something, and then it pops into my mind 10 minutes later?"; "Does everyone in the world have a doppelgänger?"; and "How well could I learn Japanese if I spent the next 40 years studying it for a few hours a week?". Compile your questions in a Word file and [submit it here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/uY7DYRP7ZOrdhz9uevrE).

#### 3 --- Playing _rock paper scissors_.
`2018-09-21`

_Instructions_: Define an AI that plays rock–paper–scissors in a human-like way. First define how the player will represent the game (its mental representation); then define its strategy (a process over that mental representation). Find a friend to play a few rounds against the player you have defined. Write 500–1000 words defining the representation and process you chose. What aspects of human behavior does your model capture? What aspects of human behavior does your model fail to capture? Write up your assignment in a Word file and [submit it here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/c57aoUeF7Bp8UguXlshA).

#### 4 --- Intuitive cartography of mental maps.
`2018-09-28`

_Instructions_: On a large sheet of paper (at least 8.5 &times; 11 inches), draw a map of a place that you know well (e.g., a room, building, neighborhood, or city). Your map can be as detailed or abstract as you see fit, but you should spend a significant amount of time crafting it, at least an hour. (If your map is simple and abstract, consider working through a few drafts.) Critically, you should not use any external resource like Google Maps or a building floor plan to help you out. On the back, write a few sentences pointing out what properties of the world your map brings to the fore and what properties it does not.

Then repeat the process. However, now you should create a map of your own mental map of the place, in the context of a particular task or activity you have done there. Again, on the back write a few sentences pointing out what properties of your mental map your map brings to the fore and what properties it does not.

Take a photo of your maps, or scan them, and [submit them as a JPG or PDF here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/5TdCK2cnzFTjTWGFoBYz).
