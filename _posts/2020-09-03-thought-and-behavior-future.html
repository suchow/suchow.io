class: center, middle, statement, dark

This course is on computational models of thought and behavior.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems. Pinker's Robot Challenge reveals some.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
To approximately solve them, the mind uses an arsenal of {mental organs, faculties, subsystems, modules, neural networks, machinery, gizmos, widgets}.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Once identified, the trick is to then reverse engineer the mind's approximate solution to that problem.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Each problem/solution can be analyzed using Marr's levels-of-analysis framework: computational, representational/algorithmic, implementation.

Predicting the future

# The delta _t_ argument, problem statement
- The current time is _t_<sub>now</sub>.
- Events have a beginning, _t_<sub>begin</sub>, and an end, _t_<sub>end</sub>.
- We know _t_<sub>now</sub> and _t_<sub>begin</sub>, but not _t_<sub>end</sub>.
- Our goal is to predict _t_<sub>end</sub>.

---
# The delta _t_ argument, setup
- By the Copernican principle, there's no reason to believe we are special&hellip;
- &hellip;i.e., _t_<sub>now</sub> could be anywhere in the interval _t_<sub>begin</sub> to _t_<sub>end</sub>.
- We can formalize that uncertainty as a uniform distribution over the interval.
<center><img width="25%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/cognition/uniform.png" /></center>
- What decision rule, based on  _t_<sub>now</sub> and _t_<sub>begin</sub>, will produce the most accurate estimate of _t_<sub>end</sub>?

# The delta _t_ argument, prediction
<img width="25%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/cognition/uniform.png" />
- Given this, what should be predict about _t_<sub>end</sub>?

# The delta _t_ argument, conclusion
- The best prediction for how long an event will last into the future is how long it has lasted thus far, Î”_t_.

???

The major takeaway concepts here are that probability can be used to describe our uncertainty, but making a decision requires us to resolve that uncertainty in some way.

# Optimal predictions in everyday cognition

Say we come across a person who is 20 years old.

How long will they live? Apply the delta _t_ argument.

What went wrong?

# Bayes' theorem

</center>
???
Let A be the event that "the coin I chose is the fair coin".
Let B be a sequence of flips "heads, heads, heads"

Key terms here are the posterior probability, the prior probability and the likelihood.

Use the example of a coin flip.

# Bayes' theorem, in context

</center>

???

There are two components here: the likelihood and the prior. The likelihood is given to us by the delta _t_ argument. The prior is learned from experience.

---

# Your priors.

Let's draw some:
- The average temperature tomorrow.
- How many cats I have.
- How many children I have.
- Quickest I've ever run a mile.
- Time this class will actually end.
