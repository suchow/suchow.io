< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent time.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Perception is bounded temporally, with events that are too quick or too slow. We create technologies to perceive temporal scales beyond these bounds (e.g., Muybridge's photos of a galloping horse).

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We represent the past, the present, and the future.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The present moment is a physical reality, but the present as an extended interval is a psychological construction (the "specious present").

"Living systems contain self-sustaining biochemical and biophysical oscillations,
whose periods range from fractions of a second to a year and perhaps
more" &mdash;&nbsp;Gallistel

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have a circadian rhythm (e.g., that guy in a cave).

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have neural oscillations at a range of frequencies.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And disorders, such as Parkinson's, seem to affect the timescale of experience and action.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent cause and effect.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Causation does not equal correlation, but even so, from correlations we can infer causality.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Michotte's studies of launching events were some of the early experiments on the perception of causality. Manipulating the timing and other factors affect perception of causality.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
From Heider & Simmel's movies of correlated movements of shape, we infer a whole world of causal factors, such as chasing and hiding.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Causal graphical models (Bayes nets) are a useful tool for representing the causal structure of probabilistic events. They are made up of nodes that represent events or properties, directed edges that represent causation, and (conditional) probability tables that attach to nodes.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One can draw a casual model that reflects our best understanding of causality, or instead one that reflects a person's incorrect theory about how a particular causal system works.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Occam's razor is the idea that simpler explanations are better explanations. But what is "simpler"? Fewer root causes? Fewer nodes in the casual graphical model? It's up for debate.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Networks aren't usefuly only for representing causality through Bayes nets.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to represent the structure of our knowledge.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to describe social ties.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to learn.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Networks are made up of {nodes, vertices, entities} and {edges, links}, and can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent other people, their thoughts, their thoughts about our thoughts, &c.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Theory of mind is the spark of social cognition, as seen in the Sally-Anne task.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
There is a debate as to whether theory of mind is best thought of as an intuitive theory ("Theory theory") or rather is the result of simulating what others would think using your own mind ("Simulation theory").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Many social scenarios benefit from social reasoning and their essences are captured in economic games.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Consider Keynesian beauty contests.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Schelling coordination games and focal points ("Schelling points").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And the El Farol Problem / minority game.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
But social reasoning has its limits &mdash; it is bounded.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One such limit is a recursion limit, how many nested layers of thinking about think we can do.
