This course is still about cognition.

The QALMRI method can be used to analyze an experiment by considering the (Q)uestion, (A)lternataive hypotheses, (L)ogic and design, (M)ethods, (R)esults, and (I)nferences.

Being curious pays off. Everyday experiences, like getting lost or seeing an animal do something suprising, can be mined for interesting cognitive phenomena.

The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems. Pinker's Robot Challenge reveals some. You came up with many others.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
To approximately solve them, the mind uses an arsenal of {mental organs, faculties, subsystems, modules, neural networks, machinery, gizmos, widgets}.

Once identified, the trick is to then reverse engineer the mind's approximate solution to that problem.

---

Each problem/solution can be analyzed using Marr's levels-of-analysis framework: computational, representational/algorithmic, implementation.

The story psychology tells itself is that behaviorism (e.g., Watson, Skinner) replaced a hundred years of introspective studies of consciousness, and then there was the cognitive revolution (Tolman, Chomsky, and many more) circa 1950.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Early evidence that behaviorism isn't the whole story came from Tolman's work on cognitive maps in rats.

- "latent" learning. latent means hidden, existing but not yet revealed.
- "We used two control groups
—one that never found food in the
maze (HNR) and one that found it
throughout (HR). The experimental
group (HNR—R) found food at the end
of the maze from the 11th day on and
showed the same sort of a sudden drop."

# Homo economicus

- Expected utility theory
- Probability weighting possible outcomes
- 25% shot at $10.00 or 75% at $5.00?
- Utility vs. value

???

The term homo economicus, or economic man, is a caricature of economic theory framed as a "mythical species" or word play on homo sapiens, and used in pedagogy.[1] It stands for a portrayal of humans as agents who are consistently rational and narrowly self-interested, and who usually pursue their subjectively-defined ends optimally.

---

# A return to Marr&rsquo;s levels

- Computational
- Algorithmic/representational
- Implementation

---

# Counterexamples to &ldquo;homo economicus&rdquo;

1. When less is more and worse is better
2. Availability bias
3. Representativeness bias
4. Anchoring and adjustment bias
5. Certainty effect
6. Reflection effect
7. Isolation effect

---

# When less is more, the setup.

Assumptions of _homo economicus_ model:
- More is better, better is better
- What others get shouldn't matter
- What might have been shouldn't matter

---

# However...

Which one is worse, missing a flight by 5 minutes and watching it pull away from the gate without you, or missing that same flight by 30 minutes? (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982)
???

In both cases, the outcome is the same --- you miss the flight and have to take the next one or reschedule. What's different in the two cases?

Let's everyone try to think of an example where this has happened to you.

[Sad olympians...](https://sports.yahoo.com/photos/olympics-silver-medal-expressions-slideshow/olympics-day-9-gymnastics-artistic-photo-1344256222.html)

You're not the only one to have had something terribly sad like this happen to you.

For example, consider the olympic games...

Counterfactuals, e.g. "but-for causation"

<img width="40%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/cognition/medvec.png" />

???

"We videotaped all of the National Broadcasting Company
(NBC) coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympic games in Barcelona,
Spain."

Just as a bit of a preview, this idea of counterfactual reasoning plays a large part on our judgments of causality. In fact, in law there is a concept of "but-for causality", which uses counterfactual reasoning explicitly, asking whether it's true that but for the action, the result would not have happened. (For example, but for running the red light, the collision would not have occurred.)

---
# Availability bias

- Computing expected utility requires estimating probability
- The availability heuristic biases estimates of probability

???

Activity: spend a couple minutes thinking of some examples where the availability of something makes it seem more probable, and where the unavailability of something makes it seem less probable.

---
# Representativeness bias

- Computing expected utility requires estimating probability
- The representativeness bias affects estimates of probability (base-rate neglect)

???

---
# Representativeness bias, an example

A group of police officers have breathalyzers displaying false drunkenness in 5% of the cases in which the driver is sober. However, the breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person. One in a thousand drivers is driving drunk. Suppose the police officers then stop a driver at random, and force the driver to take a breathalyzer test. It indicates that the driver is drunk. We assume you don't know anything else about him or her. How high is the probability the driver is really is drunk?

???

Many answer as high as 95%, correct answer is around ~2%.

---
# Anchoring and adjustment bias

- Computing expected utility requires estimating value
- The initial values considered bias (anchor) those estimates

???

Most famous examples are:
- 1 x 2 x 3 ... vs. 9 x 8 x 7 ...
- Estimating everyday quantities with a hint.

Activity: think of a value that you believe the group

---
# The certainty effect
<img width="70%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/cognition/allais.png" />

???

Notice that the bottom row is the same as having a 25% of the top row, yet the preferences reverse.

---
# More certainty effect
<img width="65%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/cognition/certainty.png" />

???

In these problems, expected utility theory says the two options are equally good. But in reality, when there's a substantial chance of winning, people pick the more certain outcome, but when there's a miniscule chance of winning, they go for the riskier option with the bigger possible gain.

---

# The reflection effect
<img width="95%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/cognition/reflection-effect.png" />

???

- Risk aversion for gains, risk seeking for losses
- Outcomes with certainty are overweighted relative to uncertain cases in both directions

---

# The isolation effect

<img width="95%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/cognition/isolation-effect.png" />

???

"In order to simplify the choice between alternatives, people often disregard
components that the alternatives share, and focus on the components that
distinguish them" (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)

Note that this is exactly like problems 3 and 4 earlier, depending on whether you include the intro or not.

# Prospect theory
<img align="right" width="40%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/cognition/prospect-value-function.png" />

- Editing phase, subtracts out elements shared across options
- Evaluation phase, feeds options through non-linear value function over *changes* in comparison to some reference point
