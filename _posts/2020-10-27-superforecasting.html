# Scoring predictions: the Brier score

- Mean squared error between prediction and reality.
- Reality is either 0 or 1.
- Prediction is the forecast.

# Scoring predictions: LLO model

- Odds ratios are p/(1-p)
- Log odds ratio is log(p/(1-p))
- Linear in log odds adds two linear bias terms, shift and scale
