< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We also have representations of objects, time, cause and effect, and other people and their thoughts about other people, &c.

Language comprehension must go beyond learning statistics of transitions between words, given that "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is absurd but syntactically unobjectionable.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The organizational framework that linguistics and cognitive psychologists use to think about language begins at phonology, and proceeds through morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
At each level of the organizational framework are phenomena characteristic of it, including the McGurk effect, cross-culutral differences phonemic repertoire, generativity (infinite use of finite means), polysemy, indeterminacy of reference, semantic ambiguity, and the four Gricean maxims of conversational cooperation.

Language is also central to several of cognition's great debates, including nativism vs. empiricism, linguistic relativity, and prescriptivism vs. descriptivism.

# Defining words, redux.

- "Bird"
- "Mother"

---

# Why the need for categories?

- Features are correlated

---

# The definitional theory of concepts.

- Defines a concept by its component features
- Definition should be without exceptions
- Intension and extension

???

Intension == necessary features
Extension == list of everything that meets definition

---

# The definitional theory of concepts (problems)

- Can all concepts be precisely defined?
- Some members are "better" than others

???

German shepard vs. pekinese dog, armchair is better furniture than reading lamp

---

# The prototype theory of concepts.

<img style="float:right" width="25%" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/cognition/smiths.jpg" />

- Features are neither necessary or sufficient
- Instead, there is a "family resemblance structure" (Wittgenstein, 1953)
- Prototypes + deviations

---

# Hierarchical organization of categories

- Basic-level categories

- Superordinate-level categories

- Subordinate-level categories

Practice drawing out a semantic network of categories.

---

# Basic-level categories

- Kids learn them first
- Shortest names
- Broadest categories whose members have many features in common
- Similar motor programs (affordances)
- Similar shapes
- Can be identified by an average shape of members in the class
- Broadest category for which a concrete image of whole can be formed
- First categorizations made during perception
- Most common across languages
- Most used within languages

# The shape bias.
