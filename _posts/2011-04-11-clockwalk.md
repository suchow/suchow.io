Normally, clocks tick once per second, with time moving forward at a constant rate, one second per second. The stochastic clock, in constrast, has ticks that are uniformly distributed between 0&ndash;2 seconds, such that time takes a biased random walk forward. Take a look. If you're lucky you may grab a few extra seconds.

What if time really worked this way? Would you be willing to increase the variance of the walk? *By how much?*
