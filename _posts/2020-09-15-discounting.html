# Some food for thought...

- Would you prefer $100 now or $105 in a week?
- Would you prefer $100 in 1 year or $105 in 1 year & 1 week?
- What is the "rational" choice in each case? Why?
- What makes a choice rational?

# Temporal discounting

- Preference for a SSR vs. a LLR
- Indifference points (in time)

???

The indifference point is the point in time that makes the SSR == LLR.

# Exponential discounting

- Utility decays by a constant percentage over time
- Decay *rate* is proportional to utility
- Discounting function exp(-kD)

# Hyperbolic discounting

- A "time-inconsistent" model ("dynamically inconsistent")
- Utility decays by a descreasing percentage over time
- Hyperbolic function 1 / (1 + kD), where D is delay and k is a free parameter

For example, in an early study subjects said they would be indifferent between receiving $15 immediately or $30 after 3 months, $60 after 1 year, or $100 after 3 years. These indifferences reflect annual discount rates that declined from 277% to 139% to 63% as delays got longer.

The most important consequence of hyperbolic discounting is that it creates temporary preferences for small rewards that occur sooner over larger, later ones. Individuals using hyperbolic discounting reveal a strong tendency to make choices that are inconsistent over time – they make choices today that their future self would prefer not to have made, despite knowing the same information. This dynamic inconsistency happens because hyperbolas distort the relative value of options with a fixed difference in delays in proportion to how far the choice-maker is from those options.[7]

# "Irrationality"

- What is it?
- One definition is violating an *axiom* of decision making
- However...

# Rational snacking

- Kidd et al. (2013)

Children are notoriously bad at delaying gratification to achieve later, greater rewards (e.g., Piaget, 1970)—and some are worse at waiting than others. Individual differences in the ability-to-wait have been attributed to self-control, in part because of evidence that long-delayers are more successful in later life (e.g., Shoda, Mischel, & Peake, 1990). Here we provide evidence that, in addition to self-control, children’s wait-times are modulated by an implicit, rational decision-making process that considers environmental reliability. We tested children (M = 4;6, N = 28) using a classic paradigm—the marshmallow task (Mischel, 1974)—in an environment demonstrated to be either unreliable or reliable. Children in the reliable condition waited significantly longer than those in the unreliable condition, suggesting that children’s wait-times reflected reasoned beliefs about whether waiting would ultimately pay off. Thus, wait-times on sustained delay-of-gratification tasks (e.g., the marshmallow task) may not only reflect differences in self-control abilities, but also beliefs about the stability of the world.
