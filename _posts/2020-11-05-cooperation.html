# The Prisoner's Dilemma

- Two options, cooperate or defect
- Best if both cooperate
- Worst if both defect
- But...

???

Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison
If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free
If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

# Pareto optimality, Nash equilbrium

- Pareto: nobody can switch without making other worse off
- Nash: strategies are best responses to others

# One shot vs. repeated games

- "Iterated" prisoner's dilemma
- Chance to learn, use feedback
- What changes?

# Strategies in the IDP

- All cooperate
- All defect
- Random

# Tit-for-tat

- Robert Axelrod's tournaments
- Clear, nice, provocable, and forgiving

???

Firstly, It is a clear and recognizable strategy. Those using it quickly recognize its contingencies and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, it is considered to be nice as it begins with cooperation and only defects in following competitive move. The strategy is also provocable because it provides immediate retaliation for those who compete. Finally, it is forgiving as it immediately produces cooperation should the competitor make a cooperative move

# Evolutionary IDP

- What is the object of evolution?
- What is the "genome" of cooperation? (y, p, q)
- What is selection?

???

Frequency-dependent fitness

# Thinking through evolutionary dynamics

- Is evolution always survival of the fittest?
- Nash equlibrium vs. evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)

???

Nash: strategies are best responses to others

# Evolutionary phenomena in IPD

- Dominance (ALLD vs. ALLC)
- Bistability (ALLD vs. stochastic TFT)
- Stable polymorphism (ALLC vs. (y, 1, 0))
- Cycles (ALLC, ALLD, (y, 1, 0))

???

ALLD is dominated by (y, 1, 0);

(y, 1, 0) is dominated by ALLC;

ALLC is dominated by ALLD
