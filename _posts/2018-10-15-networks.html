Eva Graff was a 26-year-old woman living on Long Island, living with her parents while going to graduate school for nutrition, and one Saturday night, she was at home organizing her closet. Eva had been invited to a party that night by her friend Linda, but Eva wasn't sure if she wanted to go, and was finding the closet organizing to be engaging. Her mother, Miriam Graff, walked into her room and gently derided her, saying, "You know, you'll never meet someone in your closet". Perhaps Eva took her mother's advice to heart, or perhaps she found the statement to be the kind of statement that makes a person strongly want to get their mother out of their hair, but in any case she went to the party. Linda, the host of the party, had invited many other people, including a guy she was dating named Danny. Danny had a brother Steve, who he invited to come along with him. Eva and Steve met eachother at the party and spent the whole night talking. When Steve left for the night, Linda and Eva were talking, and Linda said, "You know, I bet the two of you get married". They did, and five years later, I was born.
