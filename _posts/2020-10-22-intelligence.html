Selection.

# Eugenics

Claims:
- There is measurable variation across people (scientific)
- Some of the variants are desirable (moral/political)
- Selective breeding CAN in principle be used to increase abundance of those variants (scientific)
- Selected breeding SHOULD be used to that end (moral/political)

# American eugenics

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e3/United_States_eugenics_advocacy_poster.jpg"/>

???

In the first half of the 20th century, approximately 60,000 people were sterilized under U.S. eugenics programs. Eugenic laws in 32 states empowered government officials in public health, social work and state institutions to render people they deemed “unfit” infertile.

California led the nation in this effort at social engineering. Under California’s eugenic law, first passed in 1909, anyone committed to a state institution could be sterilized. Between the early 1920s and the 1950s, approximately 20,000 people – one-third of the national total – were sterilized in California state institutions for the mentally ill and disabled.

# Nazi eugenics

"You will be interested to know that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of intellectuals who are behind Hitler in this epoch-making program. Everywhere I sensed that their opinions have been tremendously stimulated by American thought... I want you, my dear friend, to carry this thought with you for the rest of your life, that you have really jolted into action a great government of 60 million people."

&mdash; C. M. Goethe, founder of the Eugenics Society of Northern California, in 1934

???

The Nazis were well aware of the American eugenics movement and drew inspiration from it.

Upon returning from Germany in 1934, where more than 5,000 people per month were being forcibly sterilized, the California eugenics leader C. M. Goethe bragged to a colleague:

people with congenital cognitive and physical disabilities (including people who were "feebleminded", epileptic, schizophrenic, manic-depressive, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, deaf, blind)

# General, crystalized, and fluid intelligence.

- General intelligence (G, g, or "g factor")
- Factor analysis of performance, leads to...
- Fluid intelligence (G_f) vs. crystallized (Gc) intelligence.

# Multiple intelligences

Howard Gardner

- musical-rhythmic
- visual-spatial
- verbal-linguistic
- logical-mathematical
- bodily-kinesthetic
- interpersonal
- intrapersonal

???

The theory of multiple intelligences differentiates human intelligence into specific 'modalities', rather than seeing intelligence as dominated by a single general ability.

# Intelligence tests, IQ tests

- Old vs. new definition of IQ
- Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)
- Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales
- Raven’s progressive matrices

???

Historically, IQ is a score obtained by dividing a person's mental age score, obtained by administering an intelligence test, by the person's chronological age, both expressed in terms of years and months. The resulting fraction is multiplied by 100 to obtain the IQ score

Now it's based on a bell curve.

# The Bell Curve

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/TheBellCurve.gif" width="30%"/>

???

The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life is a 1994 book by psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Murray, in which the authors argue that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that it is a better predictor of many personal dynamics, including financial income, job performance, birth out of wedlock, and involvement in crime than are an individual's parental socioeconomic status. They also argue that those with high intelligence, the "cognitive elite", are becoming separated from those of average and below-average intelligence. The book was controversial, especially where the authors wrote about racial differences in intelligence and discussed the implications of those differences.
