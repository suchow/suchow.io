< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We also have representations of objects, time, cause and effect, and other people and their thoughts about other people, &c.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Language comprehension must go beyond learning statistics of transitions between words, given that "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is absurd but syntactically unobjectionable.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The organizational framework that linguists and cognitive psychologists use to think about language begins at phonology, and proceeds through morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
At each level of the organizational framework are phenomena characteristic of it, including the McGurk effect, cross-culutral differences phonemic repertoire, generativity (infinite use of finite means), polysemy, indeterminacy of reference, semantic ambiguity, and the four Gricean maxims of conversational cooperation.

---

Language is also central to several of cognition's great debates, including nativism vs. empiricism, linguistic relativity (the "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis"), and prescriptivism vs. descriptivism.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We need categories for all the reasons Rosch identifies &mdash; in particular, features are correlated across objects.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One theory of what concepts are, the definitional theory, with its intensions and extensions, is lacking because not all categories can be precisely defined, and because some category members are better than others.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Another theory of what concepts are, the prototype theory, suggests that concepts are defined by a prototype and a family resemblance structure among the members.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Categories are organized hierarchically, with basic-level categories, subordinate-level categories, and superordinate-level categories.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Basic-level categories are special, and Rosch delineates their unique properties.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The primacy of basic-level categories may resolve Quine's indeterminacy of reference ("gavagai").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And the shape bias, where the learner assumes that category labels refer to the shape of an object over its surface properties, provides another constraint that helps us acquire new concepts.

# Analogies and how concepts relate.

- What analogies are and are not
- Metric similarity spaces
- `word2vec`

---

# Schoolroom analogies.

Consider:

```
PALTRY : SIGNIFICANCE ::

A. redundant : discussion
B. austere : landscape
C. opulent : wealth
D. oblique : familiarity
E. banal : originality
```

---

# Is that all analogies are good for?

No!

---

# Some examples of useful analogies

- Hofstadter's chapters are filled with 100s of examples.
- e.g., "Sour grapes"
- e.g., "*Exactly* the same thing happened to me!" and reminding.
- e.g., idioms in other languages ("avoir l’esprit d’escalier")

Driven by hunger, a fox was lusting after some grapes on a high vine, and he
jumped with all his might to reach them. But he failed, and as he walked away, he
remarked, “They aren’t yet ripe, and I don’t want to eat sour grapes."

“to come up with the ideal retort to an
annoying remark right after one has left the party and is heading down the stairs"

# Quantifying similarity between concepts.

Metric spaces:

---

# Mulidimensional scaling and PCA.
- Begin with pairwise distance matrix
- Infers an embedding in a Euclidean space
- Finds the lowest-dimensional space that preserves enough of the distances
