Bentley et al.â€™s framework assigns phenomena of personal and
collective decision-making to regions of a dual-axis map. Here, we
propose that understanding the collective dynamics of decision-making
requires consideration of factors that guide movement across the map.
One such factor is self-awareness, which can lead a group to seek out
new knowledge and re-position itself on the map.
