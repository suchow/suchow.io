< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We also have representations of objects, time, cause and effect, and other people and their thoughts about other people, &c.

# Phonology

The sound system used by a language. The basic unit is the "phoneme".

???

1. Different languages have different phonemes.
2. If you grow up surrounded by languages that don't have a distinction between certain phonemes, you may have difficulty prononucing or even hearing a difference between them as adults (Mikhal; Hrag).
3. Having an "accent" is in part using slightly different phonemes that are shifted in one direction or another (mary/merry/mary).
4. An example of sensory integration.

---

# Morphology

Words and their structure.

- "Gibberish" example

???

Suprisingly difficult to nail down what counts as a word, particularly because new words can be generated on the fly.

---

# Syntax (grammar)

"Infnite use of finite means" &mdash; Wilhelm von Humboldt

- Not narrow grammar school grammar
- Grammar is generative
- Universal grammar?

???

Humboldt is an interesting fellow...frog legs...

Big debate about whether

# Semantics

- Polysemy (e.g., "book" and contronyms).
- W.V. Quine's indeterminacy of reference. "Gavagai"

???

Won't say too much because on Monday we'll be talking about categories and relations, and one of the readings is all about words.

Book: a specific instance of a bound collection of pages. all the copies of a single published work ("Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"), the text of the work, anything with words in it, maybe even an empty set of pages bound together (like a journal).

Contronyms, sometimes called autoantonyms, are words that mean their opposites. "pitted", "to dust", "to trim"

Time flies like an arrow.

???

(declarative) Time moves in a way an arrow would.

(declarative, i.e. neutrally stating a proposition) Certain flying insects, called "time flies", enjoy an arrow.

(as an imperative) Measure the speed of flies like you would measure that of an arrow—i.e. (You should) time flies as you would time an arrow.

(imperative) Measure the speed of flies in the way an arrow would—i.e. (You should) time flies in the same manner that an arrow would time them.

(imperative) Measure the speed of flies with qualities resembling those of arrows—i.e. (You should) time those flies that are like an arrow.

# Resolving ambiguity via pragmatics.

&ldquo;Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;Grice

The Gricean maxims:
1. The maxim of **quantity**
2. The maxim of **quality**
3. The maxim of **relation**
4. The maxim of **manner**

---

# Violating and flouting the maxims.

???

These maxims (or, more precisely, their
violation) form the basis for inferences that
we draw in conversation, which Grice
called implicatures (to distinguish them
from formal logical implications)

Grice asserted that different ways of violating
these maxims give rise to different types of
implicatures.

---

# Maxim of quantity.

- Make your contribution as informative as is required.

- Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

A: Excuse me, do you know what time it is?

B1: Yes. (violating)

B2: It's 11:10. (obeying)

B3: It's 11:10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (flouting)

???

Implicature might be that it was recently Daylight Savings.

---

# Maxim of quality.

- Make your contribution one that is true.
- Do not say that which you believe to be false
- Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.

I catch ball:

S: "Jordan is a suprisingly good baseball player." (*obeying*)

I drop ball:

S: "Jordan is a surprisingly good baseball player." (*flouting*)

S: "Hey ump, open your eyes, he caught that one!" (*violating*)

???

Imagine you're talking to my sister in law Skylar, and she says.

---

# Maxim of relevance.

- Be relevant.

**A**: Is Gail dating anyone these days?

**B1**: Yes. (*obeying*)

**B2**: The chickens have large talons. (*violating*)

**B3**: She goes to Cleaveland every weekend. (*flouting*)

---

# Maxim of manner.

- Be perspicuous; avoid obscurity of expression or ambiguity; be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity); be orderly.

A: How was the concert?

B1: They were awful. (*obeying*)

B2: They played a sequence of notes that corresponded to my favorite tune. (*flouting*)

B3: The group of humans played their instruments by means of their appendages in a way that caused pleasing air vibrations to hit my ears, leaving me satisfied that I had spent the dollars on pieces of papers that granted me and other humans who I like permission to enter the arena that housed their performance (*violating*).

???

Perspicious is clearly expressed and easily understood.
Prolixity is being tediously long.

---

# Great debate \#1: universal grammar?

- Nativism vs. empiricism
- An innate set of structural rules. Or is it learned?

???

Part of a broader debate about what cognitive faculties are innate vs. acquired through experience.

---

# Great debate \#2: does language affect thought?

- Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, linguistic relativity. Holds that language influences (determines?) thought.
- Classic example is conception of time as being vertically oriented or horizontally oriented.

---

# Great debate \#3: prescriptivism vs. descriptivism.

- Can we ever say that a user of language i
