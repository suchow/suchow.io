Deep neural network representations of entities can serve as inputs to computational models of human mental representations
to predict people’s behavioral and physiological responses to
those entities. Though increasingly successful in their predictive capabilities, the implicit notion of ”human” that they rely
upon often glosses over individual-level differences in beliefs,
attitudes, and associations, as well as group-level cultural constructs. In this paper, we model shared representations of food
healthiness by aligning learned word representations with the
consensus among a group of respondents. To do so, we extend
Cultural Consensus Theory to include latent constructs structured as fine-tuned word representations. We then apply the
model to a dataset of people’s judgments of food healthiness.
We show that our method creates a robust mapping between
learned word representations and culturally constructed representations that guide consumer behavior.
