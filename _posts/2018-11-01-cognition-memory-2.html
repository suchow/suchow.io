< recap >

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems, and we have an arsenal of mental faculties for solving each of them approximately.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have representations of space, quantity, value, the future, and the past.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent time.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Perception is bounded temporally, with events that are too quick or too slow. We create technologies to perceive temporal scales beyond these bounds (e.g., Muybridge's photos of a galloping horse).

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We represent the past, the present, and the future.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
The present moment is a physical reality, but the present as an extended interval is a psychological construction (the "specious present").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
"Living systems contain self-sustaining biochemical and biophysical oscillations,
whose periods range from fractions of a second to a year and perhaps
more" &mdash;&nbsp;Gallistel

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have a circadian rhythm (e.g., that guy in a cave).

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We have neural oscillations at a range of frequencies.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And disorders, such as Parkinson's, seem to affect the timescale of experience and action.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent cause and effect.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Causation does not equal correlation, but even so, from correlations we can infer causality.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Michotte's studies of launching events were some of the early experiments on the perception of causality. Manipulating the timing and other factors affect perception of causality.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
From Heider & Simmel's movies of correlated movements of shape, we infer a whole world of causal factors, such as chasing and hiding.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Causal graphical models (Bayes nets) are a useful tool for representing the causal structure of probabilistic events. They are made up of nodes that represent events or properties, directed edges that represent causation, and (conditional) probability tables that attach to nodes.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One can draw a casual model that reflects our best understanding of causality, or instead one that reflects a person's incorrect theory about how a particular causal system works.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Occam's razor is the idea that simpler explanations are better explanations. But what is "simpler"? Fewer root causes? Fewer nodes in the casual graphical model? It's up for debate.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Networks aren't useful only for representing causality through Bayes nets.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to represent the structure of our knowledge.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to describe social ties.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can use networks to learn.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Networks are made up of {nodes, vertices, entities} and {edges, links}, and can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
We can also represent other people, their thoughts, their thoughts about our thoughts, &c.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Theory of mind is the spark of social cognition, as seen in the Sally-Anne task.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
There is a debate as to whether theory of mind is best thought of as an intuitive theory ("Theory theory") or rather is the result of simulating what others would think using your own mind ("Simulation theory").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Many social scenarios benefit from social reasoning and their essences are captured in economic games.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Consider Keynesian beauty contests.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Schelling coordination games and focal points ("Schelling points").

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
And the El Farol Problem / minority game.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
But social reasoning has its limits &mdash; it is bounded.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
One such limit is a recursion limit, how many nested layers of thinking about think we can do.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Vision is a process of inference. (Computational level.)

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
e.g., modal and amodal completion.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
e.g., bistable and multistable images.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
What makes an object an object? Spelke says: cohesion, boundedness, rigidity, and no action at a distance. (Representational level.)

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Each of these principles is revealed through habituation experiments with infants.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Two major organizing principles of the visual system are retinotopy (think of gunshot wounds producing dark spots) and hierarchy (think of multiple subsytems arranged in a network). (Implementation level.)

War of the Ghosts
One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: "Maybe this is a war-party". They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said:

"What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people."

One of the young men said,"I have no arrows."

"Arrows are in the canoe," they said.

"I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you," he said, turning to the other, "may go with them."

So one of the young men went, but the other returned home.

And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, "Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit." Now he thought: "Oh, they are ghosts." He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot.

So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: "Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick."

He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.

He was dead.
