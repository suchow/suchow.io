# On representing quantity.

The first stop on our tour of the mind is space. Every person exists somewhere in space, and a tremendous amount of our daily experience deals with making sure that we move ourselves and the objects under our control from one place to the next.

class: center, middle, statement, dark

This course is on cognition.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

The QALMRI method can be used to analyze an experiment by considering the (Q)uestion, (A)lternataive hypotheses, (L)ogic and design, (M)ethods, (R)esults, and (I)nferences.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

We applied the QALMRI method to "The sting of intentional pain" as an example.

Being curious pays off. Everyday experience can be mined for interesting cognitive phenomena.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark

We asked where you tend to get lost, how fast your hair grows in miles per hour, whether you believe in parapsychological abilities like ESP, the smartest thing you've seen an animal do, whether you've seen kids try to count, to name concepts for which English has no word, and to define "chair" and "salad".

The mind faces many maddeningly hard engineering problems. Pinker's Robot Challenge reveals some. You came up with many others.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
To approximately solve them, the mind uses an arsenal of {mental organs, faculties, subsystems, modules, neural networks, machinery, gizmos, widgets}.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Once identified, the trick is to then reverse engineer the mind's approximate solution to that problem.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Each problem/solution can be analyzed using Marr's levels-of-analysis framework: computational, representational/algorithmic, implementation.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
What exactly is a "representation"? Consider Gallistel's isomorphisms, Playfair's maps, and Victor's visualization tools.

The story psychology tells itself is that behaviorism (e.g., Watson, Skinner) replaced a hundred years of introspective studies of consciousness, and then there was the cognitive revolution (Tolman, Chomsky, and many more) circa 1950.

---

class: center, middle, statement, dark
Early evidence that behaviorism isn't the whole story came from Tolman's work on cognitive maps in rats.

- "latent" learning. latent means hidden, existing but not yet revealed.
- "We used two control groups
—one that never found food in the
maze (HNR) and one that found it
throughout (HR). The experimental
group (HNR—R) found food at the end
of the maze from the 11th day on and
showed the same sort of a sudden drop."

But maps aren't the whole story.

# Number

What is the use in being able to determine number?

---

# Two core systems, and others, too

- Individuation of distinct objects
- Approximate number system
- Counting
- Symbolic representation

---

# Individuation of distinct objects

---

# Subitizing

???

"sub" or "soob"

These are perhaps my favorite experiments in all of cognitive science.

"The JND is a constant proportion of the stimulus value."

# Counting

1. Consistently use the number words in the same order (**stable order principle**)
2. Count every item in a set only once, using only one number word (**one&ndash;one principle**)
3. Understand that the last number word used represents the cardinality of the set (**cardinal principle**)
4. Recognize that any collection of like or unlike items can be counted as a set (**abstraction principle**)
5. Understand that the result is the same no matter the order in which the objects are counted (**order-irrelevance principle**)

# Symbolic representation
- Unary
- Decimal
- Scientific notation
- Unit prefixes
- Powers, &c.
