Much of our knowledge is transmitted socially rather than
through firsthand experience. Even our memories depend on
recollections of those around us. Surprisingly, when people recall
memories with others, they do not reach the potential number
of items they could have recalled alone. This phenomenon
is called collaborative inhibition. Recently, Luhmann and Rajaram
(2015) analyzed the dynamics of collaborative inhibition
at scale with an agent-based model, extrapolating from previous
small-scale laboratory experiments. We tested their model
against human data collected in a large-scale experiment and
found that participants demonstrate non-monotonicities not evident
in these predictions. We next analyzed memory transmission
beyond directly interacting agents by placing agents into
networks. Contrary to model predictions, we observed high
similarity only within directly interacting pairs. By comparing
behavior to model predictions in large-scale experiments, we
reveal unexpected results that motivate future work in elucidating
the algorithms underlying collaborative memory.
