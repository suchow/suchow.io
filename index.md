After an undergraduate degree in computer science at Brandeis (B.S. 2009), I studied cognitive psychology at Harvard (A.M. 2011, Ph.D. 2014) and then completed a postdoc in computational cognitive science at the University of California, Berkeley.

Now I am an assistant professor at Stevens Institute of Technology.
