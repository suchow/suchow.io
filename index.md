My research uses a diverse set of tools from cognitive science, machine learning, network science, and evolutionary biology to better understand the dynamics of human cognition &mdash; how we learn to detect and recognize objects, how we maintain memories of sights and sounds, and how our thoughts and ideas evolve as they are transmitted from one person to the next.

I studied computer science at Brandeis and cognitive science at Harvard, graduating in 2014 with a PhD. Starting in the fall I'll be working as a research scientist at UC Berkeley.
