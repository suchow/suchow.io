The Sirens were beautiful creatures whose songs were so enticing that the men who heard it became enchanted, never returning home. Odysseus wanted to hear them, but knew that his willpower would fail. He strapped himself to the mast.

Willpower is notoriously weak, and so rather than relying on it, why not use Odysseus's method, changing your environment so that it does not allow you to disobey? Strap yourself to the mast.

*Straps* is a software tool for keeping you on track.

*Strap yourself in.*
