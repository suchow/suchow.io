What it means to live in a world of 7 billion.

Humans vary in many ways. Often this variation takes the form of a bell curve distributed around a typical value, with scores of people on either side of the norm. Some measures, such as IQ, are designed to make sure that this is so. Others, such as height and weight, have this property naturally.

The human mind has sophisticated machinery that adapts to the range of variation that is actually encountered in the world. That's why a baseball bat feels light after a few practice swings with an added weight, and why faces of the races you see most often look most dissimilar to each other. We're also blind to this process of normalization.

In a world with 7 billion people, it's hard to get a sense for what it really means to be average, and what it means to be Â±1, 2, 3, 4,  or 5 standard deviations from average. Having an intuitive feel for these numbers will make it easier to make absolute comparisons.

If you are 1 standard deviation above average in some trait, about 32% of people are higher and 68% of people are lower. If you were in a race with the entire world, you'd be in 2.2 billionth place.

If you are 2 standard deviations above average in some trait, about 5% of people are higher and 95% of people are lower. If you were in a race with the entire world, you'd be in 311 millionth place. You're remarkable among people around you (e.g., a 6'4" man), but unremarkable in the world.

If you are 3 standard deviations above average in some trait, about 0.3% of people are higher and 99.7% of people are lower. Out of 1000, you're #3. But in the world, there are still 19 million higher.

If you are 4 standard deviations above average in some trait, the percentages stop sounding meaningful, but you're #1 of 20,000. Yet there are still 400,000 people higher than you.

If you are 5 standard deviations above average in some trait, you're one in a million, but there are still 3800 people higher.

If you are 6 standard deviations, you are legitimately rare among humans. It's unlikely that there exists a human even 1/2 an SD higher than you, and you are one of < 15 people at this level among all humans.
