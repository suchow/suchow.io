In a footnote to his 1998 essay "Tense present", David Foster Wallace mentions a language game that will keep a kid entertained for hours:  generate a sentence that has the word "that" five times in a row.

With some effort, most adults can generate a sentence with five. It's a sentence that a grammar teacher might say 

Up for a challenge? Generate a sentence that contains an alternating sequence of {"that"} and {"it's", "its"}, with at most two mentions of either. Can you beat ten?
